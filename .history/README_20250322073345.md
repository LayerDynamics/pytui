# pytui - Python Terminal UI for Script Execution

A terminal user interface for visualizing Python script execution, including real-time output, call graphs, and exceptions.

## Development

### Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
pytest
```

By default, slow tests that involve actual file I/O and process execution are skipped. To run all tests including slow ones:
```bash
pytest --run-slow
```

Skipped tests include:
- `test_execution` in `test_executor.py`: Tests actual script execution and output collection
- `test_restart` in `test_executor.py`: Tests process restart functionality

These tests are skipped by default to speed up the development cycle, but should be run before commits to ensure full functionality.

### Test Categories

- **Fast Tests**: Unit tests and mocked integration tests (~1-2s)
- **Slow Tests**: Real file I/O and process execution tests (opt-in with `--run-slow`)
