= SPEC-001: Python Package Visual Terminal UI (pyviz)
:sectnums:
:toc:


== Background

As Python development environments become increasingly script-heavy and modular, developers often lack a clean, interactive interface to explore the structure and documentation of Python packages from the terminal. Existing solutions such as `pydoc` or `help()` are static, text-dump based, and do not offer structured visual exploration.

Inspired by tools such as `terminal-ui` in the JavaScript ecosystem, this project aims to build a Python-based TUI (Terminal UI) package that can be invoked via CLI or embedded in other scripts. The tool will enable developers to quickly and visually inspect the structure of Python packages — including classes, functions, attributes, and docstrings — and, in future iterations, visualize real-time execution traces.

== Requirements

- **Must Have**
  - CLI wrapper (e.g., `pytui run <script.py>`) to run a Python script through the TUI.
  - Real-time capture and display of:
    - Standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) streams.
    - Function call traces with file/line references.
    - Exceptions and stack traces in structured panels.
  - Interactive UI elements:
    - Collapsible panels (e.g., Output, Call Graph, Logs).
    - Real-time progress spinners or loading bars for long-running tasks.
    - Keyboard shortcuts to pause, stop, and re-run scripts.
  - Responsive TUI layout with rich text styling and animations (`textual`-based).

- **Should Have**
  - Visual call graph or execution sequence diagram rendered as the script runs.
  - Highlighting of currently executing function in the graph/tree view.
  - Inline display of variable values at call sites (basic local variables).
  - Filter/keyword search through live logs and output.

- **Could Have**
  - Real-time charts for numeric output or logged metrics (auto-detected).
  - Visual diff view between multiple runs.
  - Plugin support for custom runtime visualization extensions.

- **Won’t Have (for MVP)**
  - Full-step debugging control (set breakpoints, step into/out).
  - Persistent historical run storage.
  - Cloud-based streaming visualization.
