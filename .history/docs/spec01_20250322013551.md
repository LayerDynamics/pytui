= SPEC-001: Python Package Visual Terminal UI (pyviz)
:sectnums:
:toc:


== Background

As Python development environments become increasingly script-heavy and modular, developers often lack a clean, interactive interface to explore the structure and documentation of Python packages from the terminal. Existing solutions such as `pydoc` or `help()` are static, text-dump based, and do not offer structured visual exploration.

Inspired by tools such as `terminal-ui` in the JavaScript ecosystem, this project aims to build a Python-based TUI (Terminal UI) package that can be invoked via CLI or embedded in other scripts. The tool will enable developers to quickly and visually inspect the structure of Python packages — including classes, functions, attributes, and docstrings — and, in future iterations, visualize real-time execution traces.

== Method

The solution will be composed of three core components:
1. **Execution Wrapper** — Launches and runs a Python script while capturing stdout, stderr, and tracing calls.
2. **Runtime Data Collector** — Captures and aggregates execution events (output lines, exceptions, call traces).
3. **Interactive TUI Renderer** — Continuously renders the live execution stream, logs, and call graphs in a dynamic terminal interface.

=== Execution Wrapper

- Scripts will be run in a subprocess with:
  - `stdout` and `stderr` pipes intercepted in real time.
  - A Python trace function (`sys.settrace`) injected using a wrapper to monitor function calls and returns.
- The subprocess will be launched with environment variables to enable hook injection.

=== Runtime Data Collector

- Will gather:
  - Lines of output from both stdout and stderr streams.
  - Events from `sys.settrace` capturing:
    - Function call, return, exceptions.
    - Filename and line numbers.
- These will be stored in a queue system consumed by the TUI.

=== Interactive TUI Renderer

- Built using `textual`.
- Panels:
  - **Output Panel:** Scrollable output logs (stdout/stderr).
  - **Call Graph Panel:** Dynamically built function call tree showing live execution flow.
  - **Exception Panel:** Displays active exceptions with tracebacks.
  - **Status Bar:** Execution status, elapsed time, controls (pause/stop).
- Keyboard Shortcuts:
  - `q` to quit, `p` to pause/resume, `r` to rerun, `/` to search logs.
