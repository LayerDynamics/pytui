= SPEC-001: Python Package Visual Terminal UI (pyviz)
:sectnums:
:toc:


== Background

As Python development environments become increasingly script-heavy and modular, developers often lack a clean, interactive interface to explore the structure and documentation of Python packages from the terminal. Existing solutions such as `pydoc` or `help()` are static, text-dump based, and do not offer structured visual exploration.

Inspired by tools such as `terminal-ui` in the JavaScript ecosystem, this project aims to build a Python-based TUI (Terminal UI) package that can be invoked via CLI or embedded in other scripts. The tool will enable developers to quickly and visually inspect the structure of Python packages — including classes, functions, attributes, and docstrings — and, in future iterations, visualize real-time execution traces.

== Requirements

- **Must Have**
  - Package introspection for any given importable Python package or module.
  - Interactive TUI display of:
    - Classes and their methods.
    - Functions with docstrings.
    - Attributes and constants.
    - Module-level docstrings.
  - Collapsible/expandable tree navigation with keyboard controls.
  - CLI entry point (e.g., `pyviz run <package_name>`).
  - Smooth animations and text rendering using `rich` or `textual`.
  - Search/filter functionality within the displayed structure.

- **Should Have**
  - Display type hints and function signatures in detail.
  - Show source file locations and line numbers.
  - Copy-to-clipboard or export-to-markdown option for documentation.
  - Mouse support for navigation.
  - Highlight deprecated or private members differently.

- **Could Have**
  - Real-time visualization of function calls and traces when running scripts.
  - Auto-refresh on file change for live exploration of development projects.
  - Plugin system for adding custom visualization modules (e.g., AST viewers).

- **Won’t Have (for MVP)**
  - Full debugging capabilities.
  - Web-based output export (beyond markdown/text).
  - Multi-language (non-Python) package visualization.
